# Signing in with passkeys

- Signing in: `AspenClient.login` answers `signedIn` or `secondFactorRequired` with a ticket,
  finished by `completeSecondFactor` or a passkey; `runPasskeyCeremony` runs any passkey
  ceremony (`signIn`, `register`, `reauthenticate`) end to end and stores the session a
  `signIn` produces. A ceremony reaches an authenticator by a `PasskeyTransport`
  (`packages/protocol/src/passkeys.ts`), chosen in `src/features/auth/passkeyTransport.ts`: the
  web client runs it in its own page when served under the server's `rpId` and offers no
  passkeys otherwise; the desktop and mobile shells hand it to the server's `/auth/passkey` page
  in the system browser, never running one in their own page. On the desktop the main process
  opens that page and listens on a one-shot loopback port for the browser's return
  (`packages/desktop/src/main/passkeyHandoff.ts`), then sends the tab back to the page to say
  it is done. On mobile the return is the `aspen://auth/passkey` URL, caught with
  `@capacitor/app` while `@capacitor/browser` shows the page, so the native projects register
  the `aspen` URL scheme (an intent filter on Android, `CFBundleURLTypes` on iOS once its
  project is made); this path has not yet run on a device.
